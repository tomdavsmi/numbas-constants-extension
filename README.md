# numbas-constants-extension
A personal extension for the Numbas system which adds both physical constants and the ability to use them in questions. Currently holds three pieces of information for each constant; name, value and units. These are returned in a dictionary, and are accessed using the normal Javascript syntax.

    get_physical_constant(name)[key]
